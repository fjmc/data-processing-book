# Introduction

The aim of these exercises is to provide students the ability and competence to process data in an automatic fashion.
The main topic surrounding these exercises will be metabolic pathway data processing, with a closer focus on the proteins that catalyse the chemical reaction those pathways, also known as _enzymes_.
Despite working with metabolic pathways during the classes, the data processing methods that the students will learn in this class can be applied to many other types of data.

## Data

The following figure represents the first steps in the glycolysis, a metabolic pathway that decomposes glucose in smaller chemical compounds.
This figure includes a representation of five steps in this pathway, each one catalysed by a different enzyme.

For this class, we will provide [an Excel file](files/metabolic_pathways.xls) with information on 297 metabolic pathways.
Each line in this file contains:

- an identifier of the metabolic pathway;
- the name of the pathway;
- the class it belongs to;
- a list of the enzymes that participate in the pathway.

Therefore, the Excel file has 297 lines, plus another one for the column headers.

The following image shows a screenshot of the Excel file and its data

This information comes from an online database called [Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg2.html). The enzymes are referred by their UniProt code.
[UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/) is a database of proteins that contain, among a vast amount of information, the aminoacid sequences of the proteins.

## Processing

Despite the data being provided to the students as an Excel file, the data processing operations will mostly be executed with a programming language.
In this class, we will use [Python](http://www.python.org)
Processing our data with Python instead of Excel offers several benefits:

- We can define a set of operations to be executed automatically, which in Excel would take a large amount of time, since it is mostly driven by user interaction rather than direct commands
- Programming languages can handle complex data types, while Excel is mostly oriented towards numeric computations

No deep knowledge of programming will be required for the class exercises, as we will provide most of the code.
In fact, the students will not directly learn the details of Python as a programming language, but will instead be given "recipes" that contain most of the necessary logic, with small snippets of missing code that the students need to fill.
However, we expect that the students familiarize themselves with Python syntax before the first module of this class by following some online courses.
For example, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) contains six modules that will help the students in this task:

- [Python Syntax](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-python-6WeG3/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096)
- [Strings & Console Output](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-sRXwR/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096)
- [Conditionals & Control Flow](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-BxUFN/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096)
- [Python Lists and Dictionaries](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-pwmb1/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096)
- [File Input/Output](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-OGNHh/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096)


# Module 1 -- Metabolic pathways data

## Part I: Notepad++ and Python

### Objectives

- Open Notepad++, write some Python code and save the file
- Execute the file with Python

### Steps

1. In the Windows start menu, open `Notepad++`.

![Open Notepad++](images/open-notepad.png "Open Notepad++")

2. Write a small "Hello World!" program and save the file in the Desktop (or in whichever folder you want) with the name `test.py`.

![The small \"Hello World\" file](images/hello-world.png "The small \"Hello World\" file")

3. In the start menu, open the command line (`cmd`).

![Starting the command line](images/open-cmd.png "Starting the command line")

4. In the terminal (the command line window), we need to navigate to the Desktop folder and then instruct Python to run our `test.py`.
   We do this by running the following commands:
```bash
cd Desktop
python test.py
```

5. Observe the output produced by python.


## Part II: Beginning data processing

### Objectives
- Understand the CSV format
- Convert between CSV and the Excel format
- Read CSV files with Python

### Input:
- File: [metabolic_pathways.xls](files/metabolic_pathways.xls)

### Output:
- File: metabolic_pathways.csv
- Console:
```awk
    Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis
    Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)
    Pentose phosphate pathway
    Pentose and glucuronate interconversions
    ...
```

### Steps:
1. Open the Excel file.
   Take special attention to the contents of this file and try to get familiar with the data it contains.
   This step is one of the most important to data processing, as it allows us to gain intuition about the information that we're dealing with.

2. Using Excel's functionalities, save the data in the CSV format.

3. Open the CSV file in a text editor (Notepad++) and study the file that you saved.
   For example, determine what character is used to separate the various fields of the data, whether the fields are delimited and how, etc.

4. Read the contents of the CSV file with Python and, for each pathway, print its name.
   Use the following code, filling wherever you see a green question mark (`???`):
```python
    import csv
    f = open('metabolic_pathways.csv')   # Open the file
    paths = csv.reader(f, delimiter=???) # Create a CSV reader object
    for path in paths: # For each pathway ...
        print ???      # ... print its name
```

### Quiz:
1. How would you change the Python code to print the class of each pathway instead of its name?
2. Explain why, in the CSV file, some fields are delimited by quotes (`"`) and other are not.
